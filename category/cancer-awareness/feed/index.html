<h2 class="wp-block-heading">November 1st – November 30th</h2>



<p>Although Pancreatic cancer only comes 11<sup>th</sup> in the cancer charts, its mortality rate is much higher than the more common cancers pushing it up into 5<sup>th</sup> place for mortalities. On average 8,500 people a year die from Pancreatic cancer which equates to just over 15 people for every 100,000-population making it the deadliest common cancer in the UK.&nbsp; The survival rate for 5 years or more is only 6.9%, this could be down to the fact that 60% of people who are diagnosed are diagnosed at stage 3 and 4. Almost half, who are diagnosed are diagnosed as emergency admittance resulting in a survival rate of 3 times less than those who are diagnosed by their GP.</p>



<p>Signs of pancreatic cancer can be pain in your tummy/back, indigestion, jaundice, unexplained weight loss and changes to your bowel habits plus many more which makes it much harder to detect as there are no definite signs and new symptoms your body is showing can be overlooked as just being unwell or being run down. It is always best to get any new symptoms checkout especially if they persist for more than a week.</p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is more common in those over 75 years of age but is becoming seen in those who are 40 and over.</p>



<p>Thursday 19<sup>th</sup> November 2020 is WORLD PANCREATIC CANCER DAY, people across the globe join forces to raise awareness about the symptoms and risks of this disease and the urgent need for early detection.</p>



<p>DRESS IN PURPLE AND SHOW YOUR SUPPORT!</p>
